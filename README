# Zotero Scholar Citations

This add-on is a plugin for Zotero, a research sources management tool, which is a Firefox extension. The add-on automatically fetches numbers of citations of sources from Google Scholar and makes it possible to sort your sources by the citations. Moreover, it allows batch updating of the citations, as they may change over time.

Currently, Zotero doesn't have any special field for the number of citations, that's why it is stored in the "Call Number" field. To sort by this field you have to add it in the source listing table.
