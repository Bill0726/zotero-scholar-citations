# Zotero Scholar Citations

This add-on is a plugin for Zotero, a research source management tool, which is a Firefox extension. The add-on automatically fetches numbers of citations of your Zotero items from Google Scholar and makes it possible to sort your items by the citations. Moreover, it allows batch updating the citations, as they may change over time.

When updating multiple citations in a batch, the plugins makes a 1 minute delay after every 50 items to try to avoid being blocked by Google Scholar for multiple automated requests.

Currently, Zotero doesn't have any special field for the number of citations, that's why it is stored in the "Call Number" field. To sort by this field you have to add it in the source listing table.
